# 🌱 Learning Journey App

**Designed & Developed by Deemah Alhazmi**  
☕ Fueled by creativity, SwiftUI, and a good cup of coffee

## 🍎 About This Project

This project was created as part of my **second challenge at the Apple Developer Academy**.  
The **design was provided** by our team, and I was responsible for the **development and coding** of the app using **SwiftUI** and the **MVVM architecture**.

## 📱 App Preview

Here’s a glimpse into **Learning Journey** 👇  

| Onboarding | Activity Page | Learning Goal | Calendar |

> 💡 Tip: Place your screenshots inside a folder named **images** in your project root,  
> and rename them like `onboarding.png`, `activity.png`, etc.

## 🎯 What is Learning Journey?

**Learning Journey** helps users stay consistent with their personal learning goals —  
encouraging daily progress and reflection through simple, gamified tracking.

You can:
- Set a learning goal (e.g., "Learn Swift")
- Choose your plan (week, month, or year)
- Log each day as **Learned** or **Frozen (Rest)**
- View your overall progress in a beautiful calendar

---

## 🪄 How It Works

### 🧩 Step 1: Start Learning
1. **Onboarding** → Enter your goal and duration  
2. **Activity Page** → Start tracking your learning journey

---

### ✍️ Step 2: Log Your Progress  
- ✅ **Learned Today** → Marks the day in **orange** (progress made)  
- 🧊 **Freeze Day** → Marks the day in **teal** (rest day taken)

---

### 🔁 Step 3: Update or Change Your Goal  
If you complete or wish to modify your goal:
- Tap the **Learning Goal icon**
- Update your topic or duration  
- Confirm changes (your streak resets for a fresh start!)

---

### 📅 Step 4: View Your Calendar  
See your full progress across days, weeks, and months.  
Scroll through your calendar to reflect on how far you’ve come.

## 🧠 Architecture

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Model** | Handles data like goals, plans, and daily logs |
| **View** | Displays app screens (Onboarding, Activity, Goal, Calendar) |
| **ViewModel** | Connects the data and logic between Model and View |

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SwiftUI 5** → Modern, declarative UI framework  
- **Combine** → Reactive event handling  
- **MVVM** → Clean and organized architecture  
- **@AppStorage** → Local data persistence  

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Daily reminder notifications  
- Achievement badges for streaks  
- Progress sharing with friends
