# 🌱 Learning Journey App

**Designed & Developed by Deemah Alhazmi**  
☕ Fueled by creativity, SwiftUI, and a good cup of coffee.

## 🎯 What is Learning Journey?

**Learning Journey** helps you stay consistent with your goals — learn something new, track your progress, and see how far you’ve come.  
You can log your days as **Learned** or **Frozen (Rest)** and visualize your growth in a calendar view.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 🪄 Step 1: Start Learning  
1. **Onboarding** → Enter what you want to learn and how long you plan to learn it (week, month, or year).  
2. **Activity Page** → Begin your journey and start tracking your daily progress.

---

### ✍️ Step 2: Log a Day  
- ✅ **Log as Learned** → Marks the day in **orange** (you made progress 🎉)  
- 🧊 **Log as Frozen** → Marks the day in **teal** (you took a rest day)  

---

### 🔁 Step 3: Update or Change Your Goal  
If your goal is completed or you’d like to start something new:  
- Tap the **Learning Goal icon**  
- Edit your goal or duration  
- Confirm the update → your streak resets for a fresh start!  

---

### 📅 Step 4: View Your Calendar  
Check your **Learned** and **Frozen** days at a glance.  
Scroll freely through past months and reflect on your progress.

## 🧩 App Structure (MVVM)

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Model** | Stores data such as goals, dates, and daily statuses. |
| **View** | Displays all app screens (Onboarding, Activity, Goal, Calendar). |
| **ViewModel** | Connects the logic between model and view. |
